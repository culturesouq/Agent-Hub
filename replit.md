# OpSoul v2.4 — Complete

AI operator platform with 5-layer identity architecture, dual knowledge bases, GROW self-evolution system, multi-tenant JWT auth, and pgvector semantic search.

## Services & Startup

The platform has two services that must both be running:

| Service | Workflow | Port | Purpose |
|---------|----------|------|---------|
| `opsoul-api` | `artifacts/opsoul-api: API Server` | 3001 | Express REST API + JWT auth |
| `opsoul-hub` | `artifacts/opsoul-hub: web` | 19165 → served at `/` | React/Vite frontend |

**Development startup:** Both services are managed by the Replit artifact system and auto-start independently. If you need to start them manually, run:
```bash
bash scripts/start-dev.sh
```

**Routing:** The frontend is registered at `previewPath = "/"` via `artifacts/opsoul-hub/.replit-artifact/artifact.toml`. Visiting `/` with no auth token shows LandingPage; with a valid token shows Dashboard.

**Artifact registration (confirmed):**
- `artifacts/opsoul-hub` — registered as kind `web`, title "OpSoul Hub" (id: `artifacts/opsoul-hub`)
- `artifacts/mockup-sandbox` — registered as kind `design`, title "Canvas"
- `artifacts/opsoul-api` — Express API server (no artifact registration needed; managed as a workflow)

**Note on .replit [[artifacts]]:** The `[[artifacts]]` entries in `.replit` are managed by the platform's artifact bootstrap system and cannot be modified by agents directly (agent file tools block `.replit` edits). The stale `artifacts/api-server` entry is a legacy reference from a previous scaffold — it is harmless but cannot be cleaned up. The live artifact registrations are stored in per-artifact `artifact.toml` files and confirmed via the platform artifact registry above.

## v2.4 Session Completed Features

- **T2 Arabic detection** — Unicode `/[\u0600-\u06FF...]` detected in chat.ts → `languageInstruction` injected silently into system prompt
- **T3 API Reference** — Full code examples (curl, JS, Python) with copy buttons in Settings → API
- **T4 Connector Cards** — 5 connector cards (Gmail, GCal, Outlook, OneDrive, LinkedIn) with connect/disconnect in Integrations
- **T5 GROW Test Mode** — `POST /operators/:id/grow/test-proposal/:proposalId` runs 3 test messages through current vs proposed soul; before/after preview panel in GrowSection
- **T6 Behavior Diff Card** — Humanized proposed change display: arrays shown as pill chips, strings as readable prose (removed raw JSON pre block)
- **T7 Safe Mode** — `PATCH /:id/safe-mode` backend; toggle in Settings → Safe Mode; amber badge in header; growCron filters `safeMode = false`
- **T8 Drift Cron** — `driftCron.ts` runs every 90 days (`0 3 1 */3 *`); computes `semanticDistance(soulOriginal, soulCurrent)` → stored in `soulState`; alerts if drift > 0.30
- **T9 Theme** — Sidebar lightness raised from 14% → 18% (clearer visual separation from dark chat area); thin custom scrollbars; consistent spacing
- **T10 Mobile Nav** — Hamburger button → slide-in overlay with full sidebar nav; replaced horizontal tab bar
- **T11 GitHub** — Committed as "OpSoul v2.4 Complete" (9 files, 132 insertions); push with `git push origin main` (requires GitHub PAT — remote is `https://github.com/culturesouq/Agent-Hub`)

|---|---|
| `owners` | Platform account holders (Sovereign Admins) |

| `password_resets` | 1hr password reset tokens (SHA-256 hashed, one-time use) |

### API Server (`artifacts/opsoul-api`)

Running on **port 3001**.

**Auth routes** (`/api/auth/`):
- `POST /register` — create owner account (bcrypt 12 rounds)
- `POST /login` — returns 24hr JWT access token + 30-day refresh cookie (graceful error for Google-only accounts)
- `POST /refresh` — exchange httpOnly refresh cookie for new access token
- `POST /logout` — revoke session, clear cookie
- `POST /change-password` — require current password, revoke all sessions
- `GET /me` — return owner profile (requires Bearer token)
- `GET /google` — redirect to Google OAuth consent screen (scopes: openid email profile)
- `GET /google/callback` — exchange code, find-or-create owner by googleId/email, issue session, redirect to `/auth/google/success`
- `POST /forgot-password` — create 1hr reset token; logs reset URL to console (email delivery stub)
- `POST /reset-password` — validate token, update password, revoke all sessions

**Auth model:**
- Access token: 24hr JWT (HS256), signed with `JWT_SECRET`
- Refresh token: 30-day, stored as SHA-256 hash in `sessions` table, raw value in httpOnly cookie
- `requireAuth` middleware validates Bearer token on protected routes
- Google-only owners have `passwordHash = null` and `googleId` set; cannot use password login
- Google OAuth callback sets httpOnly cookie then redirects to `/auth/google/success` (frontend calls `/refresh` to get JWT)

**Google integration routes** (`/api/integrations/google/`):
- `POST /initiate` — requireAuth; validates operatorId ownership; returns Google authUrl with HMAC-signed state (10min TTL)
- `GET /callback` — verifies HMAC state; exchanges code; fetches Google email; upserts `operator_integrations` row (type=google, scopes=[gmail,calendar,drive]); triggers self-awareness; redirects to operator page

**Operator routes** (`/api/operators/`) — all require Bearer token:
- `POST /` — create operator (validates Layer 1 + Layer 2 soul via Zod)
- `GET /` — list all operators for authenticated owner
- `GET /:id` — get single operator with full identity layers
- `PATCH /:id` — update Layer 1 fields (owner always allowed; lock only prevents operator self-modification)
- `DELETE /:id` — permanently delete operator
- `POST /:id/lock-layer1` — lock Layer 1 identity (idempotent-safe, 409 if already locked)
- `GET /:id/soul` — get Layer 2 soul + original snapshot
- `PATCH /:id/soul` — field-level soul update (never deep merge; blocked if FROZEN)
- `POST /:id/soul/reset` — restore Layer 2 soul to original (blocked if FROZEN)
- `PATCH /:id/grow-lock` — set GROW lock level (OPEN/CONTROLLED/LOCKED/FROZEN) + optional expiry

**Layer 1 lock behavior:**
- `layer1LockedAt` is `null` at creation time
- Set explicitly via `POST /:id/lock-layer1`
- Also set automatically on first message sent (via `lockLayer1IfUnlocked` helper, called from Phase 4 chat routes)
- Lock meaning: prevents the **operator** from self-modifying its identity during GROW cycles or conversations
- Owner (authenticated user) can always update Layer 1 fields via `PATCH /:id` and `PATCH /:id/identity-from-description` regardless of lock status

**Layer 2 Soul schema (Zod-validated):**
```
personalityTraits  string[]   — e.g. ["analytical","warm","curious"]
toneProfile        string     — e.g. "calm and professional"
communicationStyle string     — e.g. "concise, avoids jargon"
quirks             string[]   — distinctive behaviors
valuesManifestation string[]  — how core values show up
emotionalRange     string     — stability profile
decisionMakingStyle string    — reasoning approach
conflictResolution string     — de-escalation strategy
```

**GROW lock levels:**
- `OPEN` — GROW can freely propose soul changes
- `CONTROLLED` (default) — GROW proposals allowed at higher confidence threshold
- `LOCKED` — GROW proposals blocked; only manual soul edits allowed
- `FROZEN` — No changes at all (manual or GROW) until `lockedUntil` expires

### Shared Utilities (`lib/opsoul-utils`)

- `validateEnv()` — hard-fails at startup if any required env var is missing
- `encryptToken(raw)` / `decryptToken(ciphertext)` — AES-256-GCM, key from `ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- `hashToken(raw)` — SHA-256 hex digest (used for refresh token storage)
- `embed(text)` — OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small` embeddings (1536-dim)
- `cosineSimilarity(a, b)` / `semanticDistance(a, b)` — vector math

## Build Phases

- **Phase 1 (complete):** Environment validation, shared utilities, full DB schema (23 tables), JWT auth API
- **Phase 2 (complete):** Operator CRUD, 5-layer identity management, Layer 1 lock logic, soul field-level updates, GROW lock control
- **Phase 3 (complete):** Dual KB ingestion (owner + operator), pgvector semantic search, confidence/verification filtering, RAG context assembly
- **Phase 4 (complete):** OpenRouter streaming/sync chat (Llama 3.3 70B), SSE, conversation CRUD, message history, KB RAG context injection, auto Layer 1 lock on first message
- **Phase 5 (complete):** GROW self-evolution system — Claude Sonnet 4-5 soul evaluation, proposal lifecycle (queued→evaluating→applied/rejected/needs_owner_review), owner decide flow, self-awareness state, daily cron 02:00 UTC, FROZEN/LOCKED guards
- **Phase 6 (complete):** Skills engine (platform library + per-operator install), integrations (AES-256-GCM token vault, never returned), mission contexts (tone/KB/GROW overrides, per-conversation activation), full system prompt injection at Layer 3
- **Phase 7 (complete):** Memory system — `operator_memory` store with vector embeddings; CRUD + semantic search + manual decay + distillation routes at `/api/operators/:id/memory`; daily 04:00 UTC decay cron (-0.05/day, auto-archive at ≤0.05); AI distillation (Llama 3.3 70B extracts facts/preferences/patterns from recent conversations, stores at confidence ≥0.7); injected into Layer 3 "Remembered Context" block at chat time (top-5, cosine ≥0.40, weight >0.1); `memoryCount` in chat responses
- **Phase 9 (complete):** OpSoul Hub frontend — React + Vite app (`artifacts/opsoul-hub`, port 19165, preview at `/`); Vite proxy `/api → localhost:3001`; custom JWT auth layer (`src/lib/api.ts` apiFetch + `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`); dark mission-control aesthetic (deep navy + cyan); pages: `/login` (register + login), `/` (operator dashboard with create/delete), `/operators/:id` (9-section operator workspace: Identity, Chat, Knowledge Base, GROW & Self-Awareness, Memory, Integrations, Mission Contexts, Skills, Capability Requests); SSE streaming chat with live typing indicator; all 9 sections wire directly to Phases 1-8 API endpoints; TypeScript clean

- **Phase 8 (complete):** Self-Awareness Engine — `buildSelfAwarenessState()` computes live identity_state (Layer 1 snapshot), soul_state (soul + GROW history counts), capability_state (integrations + skills + KB chunk counts + avg confidence), task_history (last 30 tasks + per-type success/failure breakdown), mandate_gaps (task types with ≥50% failure), health score (v2.4 weights: mandateCoverage×0.30 + mandateGaps×0.20 + kbConfidence×0.25 + growActivity×0.15 + soulIntegrity×0.10 → Strong≥70/Developing≥40/Needs Attention<40); `recomputeSelfAwareness()` preserves previous state + logs to ops_logs on failure; `triggerSelfAwareness()` is a non-blocking `setImmediate` wrapper; 5 event triggers: chat (conversation_end), owner-kb/operator-kb POST (kb_learn), integrations POST/PATCH/DELETE (integration_change), GROW decide approve (grow_approved), capability-requests POST (capability_request); `health_score` jsonb column added to `self_awareness_state`; GET route returns DB state or live-computes if no cache; POST /recompute for explicit refresh; capability-requests route: `/api/operators/:id/capability-requests` — full CRUD (GET list, POST create→fires trigger, GET single, PATCH :id/respond, DELETE)
